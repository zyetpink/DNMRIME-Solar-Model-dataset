# DNMRIME-Solar-Model-dataset
This repository contains DNMRIME code and datasets of photovoltaic and manufacturer solar models: SDM, TDM, DDM, KC200GT, ST40, and SM55.
# DNMRIME Code

This repository contains the implementation of the DNMRIME algorithm as described in the paper:

**"RIME Optimization with Dynamic Multi-dimensional Random Mechanism and Nelder-Mead Simplex for Photovoltaic Parameter"**

The main function (`main`) serves as the entry point for executing the algorithm for photovoltaic parameter optimization.
